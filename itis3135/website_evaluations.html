            <h3><a href="https://www.modaoperandi.com/">Moda Operandi</a></h3>
            <p>One of the best websites to shop at if you want to slaaaay!</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Moda Operandi excels in this aspect by employing varied font sizes and bold color choices, creating an appealing and well-organized layout.</li>

                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> The site maintains a consistent color scheme and font style across different sections, reinforcing brand identity and improving user experience.</li>

                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Every element on the website is well-aligned, enhancing readability and offering a cohesive, organized presentation.</li>

                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Sections are strategically spaced, providing just the right amount of padding to make content easily digestible.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><a href="https://www.lingscars.com/">Lings Cars</a></h3>
            <p>Car leasing website. This is the ugly one, but it has character.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The site is undeniably flashy with an overload of colors and animations. While eye-catching, this compromises the site's usability and detracts from essential content.</li>

                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Despite having a consistent color and font style, the site's excessive variety in font sizes and styles adds confusion rather than clarity.</li>

                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Lings Cars seems to ignore standard alignment principles. The lack of a unified alignment strategy results in a visually disorganized layout.</li>

                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> The site does not provide adequate spacing between sections, making the content feel cramped and challenging to navigate.</li>
