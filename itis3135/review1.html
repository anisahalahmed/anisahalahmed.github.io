            <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> This website uses a modest color palette with natural tones, reflecting the theme of hiking and nature. The use of colors is not very bold, but it is effective in highlighting different sections. However, the overall contrast could be enhanced to make certain text elements stand out more clearly against the background.</li>

            <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> The site maintains a consistent theme in terms of color and font style, which is good for brand consistency. The navigation menu and the main content area follow a similar design pattern, which aids in creating a unified look. However, the site could benefit from a bit more variety in visual elements.</li>

            <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> The alignment of elements on this website is straightforward and follows traditional design principles. Text and images are aligned in a way that is easy to follow, contributing to the site's readability and organized appearance. However, some sections could use better alignment to enhance the overall aesthetic appeal, such as unifying the aspect ratios of the images in the gallery.</li>

            <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> The spacing between different sections and elements is adequate, providing a clear distinction between various parts of the content. This spacing helps in making the website easy to navigate and ensures that the content doesnâ€™t feel too cramped. However, in some areas, the spacing could be adjusted for better visual balance. The inconsistent word spacing in the "Discover the Seasons" section is also quite awkward to look at.</li>
