            <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The website uses a simple color scheme with a white background and black/orange text, which provides okay readability. However, this minimal use of color lacks visual interest and does not effectively highlight important sections or calls to action. A more dynamic use of colors or contrasts could make key information stand out.</li>

            <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> The site maintains consistency in font style and color scheme throughout, which is beneficial for a cohesive look and feel. This repetition aids in brand recognition and provides a professional appearance. However, the uniformity in design elements might also lead to a monotonous experience for the user.</li>

            <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> The alignment, especially in the navigation bar and content justification, needs refinement. The minimal padding in the navigation bar and the left-justified content on subpages create an imbalanced and less professional look. Aligning content more centrally or evenly, and improving navigation bar spacing, can make the website more aesthetically appealing and easier to navigate.</li>

            <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> The spacing within the navigation bar and between various elements on the subpages appears inconsistent. Some sections, particularly the navigation bar, lack adequate padding, making the interface feel cramped. Conversely, the excessive open space on subpages due to left-aligned content reduces visual impact. Adjusting these spacings can create a more visually engaging and user-friendly layout.</li>
